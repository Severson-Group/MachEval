MachEval
=======================================================
MachEval is a code base designed to assist in the evaluation and optimization of electric machines. There are two primary modules: ``desopt`` which extends ``pygmo`` to handle design optimization, and ``macheval`` for evaluation and analysis of electric machines. ``macheval`` is designed to interface directly with ``emach``, a code base for modeling of electrical machines using FEA tooling.
