Welcome to eMach
=======================================================
``eMach`` is a open-source electric machine modeling, evaluation, and optimization framework developed in Python. ``eMach`` has 3 
distinct submodules, ``mach_cad``,  ``mach_eval``, and ``mach_opt``, all 3 of which work in tandem to enable the implementation of
modular solutions to electric machine optimization problems. Readers are adviced to go through the remainder of this document and
to browse through the documentation links provided on the left to familiarize themselves with the repository.
