Code Guidelines
-------------------------------------------

Developers of eMach should read this document to understand expectations of code contributed to the eMach codebase. This document outlines the 
code requirements for ``analyzers`` and ``machine_designs``. Understanding of proper Python coding practices are necessary to contribute to each 
section of ``eMach``.

Analyzers
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Analyzer modules should be located within ``mach_eval/analyzers`` and then placed within the appropriate subdirectory.

An analyzer module may contain multiple analyzers if they are interdependent. Each analyzer must consist of the following classes:

1. One Analyzer class
2. At least one Problem class  
3. One Results class

Analyzer Class
*******************************************

The Analyzer class is where the analysis operation is expected to occur. Aspects to consider:

1. Required functions:
    a. Each analyzer must provide an ``analyze(problem p)`` function that takes exactly one argument, a Problem object, and returns a Results object.
2. Optional initializer
    a. An initializer may be used to configure the analyzer's state in a manner that will be re-used across multiple problems. 
    b. The developer must have a compelling reason for why this information is not instead provided to the problem object.
3. Code comments 
    a. Provide short description of each argument / return value
    b. When appropriate, indicate sources or context for important physics expressions.

Problem Class
*******************************************

The purpose of the problem class is to provide the analyzer class the necessary information to analyze a problem. Aspects to consider:

1. Naming
    a. The problem class name should begin similarly to the analyzer class's name, i.e. ``ReallyGreatProblem`` for ``ReallyGreatAnalyzer``.
2. Code comments on user input
    a. Provide short description of each argument 
    b. Specify argument units
3. Recommended practices
    a. Provide user data through the problem class initalizer 
    b. Multiple problem classes can be defined for use with a single analyzer so that users can provide differing formats or conceptualizations of the necessary information (perhaps even requiring some computation within the problem class itself prior to being used in the analyzer).

Results Class
*******************************************

The purpose of the Results class is to encapsulate the results of the analysis operation as a single object. Aspects to consider:

1. Naming
    a. The Results class name should begin similarly to the Analyzer class's name, i.e. ``ReallyGreatResult`` for ``ReallyGreatAnalyzer``.
2. Parameters and functions:
    a. These are expected to be used to expose the analysis results to the user. 
    b. At least one parameter or function must be used.
    c. If functions are used, it is expected that these will return a value in a reasonable amount of computation time (i.e., primary computation should occur in the Analyzer's ``analyze`` function.)
3. Code comments 
    a. Provide short description of each argument (for a function) and return value (or parameter)
    b. Specify argument / return value / parameter units
